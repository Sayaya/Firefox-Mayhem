Firefox-css
===========
A css script for the Stylish Firefox addon. It takes elements from the Minimalistic Mayhem [Appchan-x](https://github.com/zixaphir/appchan-x) theme.

The version for Firefox 29+ is currently dependent on the Classic Theme Restorer and Hide Caption Titlebar Plus addons to function as intended.

Issues
-----------
* Pop-up windows are ugly and undragable
* Urlbar/searchbar border color can't be changed

To-do
-----------
* <s>Small tabs version</s>
* Phone version?
* Reduce dependencies wherever possible
