Firefox-css
===========
A css script for the Stylish Firefox addon. It takes elements from the Minimalistic Mayhem Appchan-x theme to have a slimmed look.

The Australis version is currently dependent on the Classic Theme Restorer and Hide Caption Titlebar Plus addons to function as intended.

Issues
-----------
* Pop-up windows are ugly and undragable
* Urlbar/searchbar border color can't be changed

To-do
-----------
* Small tabs version
* Phone version?
* Reduce dependencies wherever possible
